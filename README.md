# Bear-Map
This project is the implementation of project 2C of UC Barkley data structure course. 

this project is about making a map of barkely area using maney different data structure and algorithms :

A* algorithm for finding the shortest path 
TRIES DS for searching engine 
KDTree DS is using in finding the shortest path.
priority queue and its api.
