# Bear-Map
This project is the implementation of project 2C of UC Barkley data structure course (CS 61B). 

this project is about making a map of barkely area using many different data structure and algorithms :

A* algorithm for finding the shortest path. 
TRIES DS for searching engine. 
KDTree DS is using in finding the shortest path.
priority queue and its api.
